    <p><b>Variables handling:</b>
        Most of configuration fields support the substitution of environment variables.
        Due to the high risk of data collisions, newest Perforce Plugin versions enforce
        the full variable substitution in all fields. It means that checkout, 
        polling, tagging and workspace cleanup operations will fail if a field 
        contains unresolved variables.<br/>
        
        The behavior specifics:
        <ul>
            <li/> Polling, Tagging And Workspace do not have access to the build environment
            <ul>
                <li/> Plugin will substitute default 
            </ul>
            <li/> Polling, Tagging And Workspace cleanup operations do not utilize executors
            <ul>
                <li/><b>EXECUTOR_NUMBER</b> will be substituted as UNKNOWNEXECUTOR
                <li/>Workspace cleanup and checkout may use different workspace
                     names.
            </ul>
        </ul>
